                        Jason Statham was born on July 26, 1967 in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen and Barry Statham. He had an older brother named Lee and both took interest in martial arts. But Statham had other athletic passions, one of which was diving, and he began working on those skills, eventually becoming a part of the British Olympic Team that traveled to Seoul, Korea in 1988. After the Olympics, he continued as a member of the National Diving Squad for the next decade. However, after some disappointing finishes at the World Championships and Olympic trials, he decided to focus on the next chapter of his career.
                        A few years later, his athletic build caught the eye of a talent agent and landed Statham a gig in an ad campaign for the European clothing retailer French Connection. An appearance in a Levi's Jeans commercial and work for Hilfiger followed and soon Statham had a modeling career. This helped him land jobs as a background dancer in early '90s music videos like The Shamen's "Comin' On" and Erasure's "Run to the Sun."
